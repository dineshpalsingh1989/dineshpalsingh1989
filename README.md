ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dineshpalsingh1989

A passionate engineer with a deep background in vibration analysis, predictive maintenance, and condition monitoring. Iâ€™ve helped industries across Malaysia level up their reliability gameâ€”partnering with big names like SKF, Wilcoxon, Erbessd Instruments, and Viking Analytics. Over the past 4 years, Iâ€™ve led RM1.4 million+ in sales of high-end condition monitoring tools.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in...

Building IoT systems for rotating equipment monitoring

ESP32, LoRa, BLE, and CircuitPython development

Modbus, MQTT, Node-RED, Google Cloud, and secure data transmission

Making predictive maintenance smarter with AI and analytics

Exploring custom dashboards and remote sensor control systems

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

WIZnet W5500 Ethernet + SSL for secure cloud communication

Secure integration with HiveMQ and Adafruit IO

Building compact, low-power ESP32-C3 sensor nodes with BLE

Real-time data visualization using Dash, InfluxDB, and Plotly

 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on...

Predictive maintenance projects

Smart sensor solutions for industrial use

Edge AI systems for vibration pattern recognition

Anything related to sensor integration, cloud, or reliability tech

âš¡ Fun fact:

Iâ€™ve balanced blowers, aligned pumps, serviced vacuum systems, and even trained others on high-tech vibration toolsâ€”all while coding sensor dashboards from scratch. I bring hands-on field experience and technical skills to the same table.
